# manual calculator
The manual calculator project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application implemented in Python using the Tkinter library. This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator's interface consists of a display entry widget at the top, where users can input mathematical expressions using buttons for digits, decimal point, and operators. The GUI includes buttons for numbers 0-9, decimal point, and common arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). Users can input a series of operations and press the "=" button to calculate the result.

The "C" button allows users to clear the entry, providing a convenient way to correct or reset their input. The code utilizes the eval function to evaluate the entered mathematical expression and display the result in the entry widget.
